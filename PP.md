# Boxfish Privacy Policy

_This policy is effective October 11, 2024_

the_dise builds the Boxfish application as an open source application. The Service is provided free of charge by the_dise and is intended to be used as is.

Boxfish respects and protects the personal privacy of all users, and for this reason we make this Privacy Policy available to the general public. **By using Boxfish, you signify that you have read and agree to the terms and conditions herein, and if you do not agree to the terms and conditions herein, please stop using Boxfish and uninstall it immediately.**

## Information Collection

The Boxfish software itself does not send any information to the developer, but the application marketplace where you download the software (e.g. Google Play) may collect information about the running status of the application and provide it to the Boxfish developer. For this information, please read the privacy policy provided by the application marketplace you use.

The Boxfish software may contain features that require IAP payments to unlock, and your payment information will be processed by the relevant IAP channel, and we do not have access to the payment information.

When you provide feedback to Boxfish developers about errors in the operation of the software, the developers may ask you to provide logs of the software and the system to help identify the cause of the problem. Because logs may contain sensitive information, such information should only be sent by you.
**We do not make any express or implied warranty for the security and privacy of any transmission service, so please choose a method acceptable to you when transmitting the relevant information.**

## Information Sharing

We do not sell collected user data to any third party. We may provide information to outside developers to assist in the development of the software, but we will communicate the confidentiality obligations and make sure they can be honored before providing the information.

## Storage of Information

Unless required by law, we will erase user data that is no longer required for further use or consolidate statistical data into aggregate reports that do not identify individual users within 30 days.

## Leakage of Information

We endeavor to protect user data using reasonable technical and security means, but cannot guarantee absolute security. If we confirm that a data breach has occurred, we will notify users within 7 days through available channels. **You agree not to hold us liable for losses caused by force majeure.**

## Children's Privacy

The Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If I become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary action.

## Modification of Terms

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy, but will ensure that users are notified via our available channels and in-app alerts at least 30 days prior to updating the terms. **Continued use of the Software after the new terms take effect signifies your agreement to the revised Privacy Policy.**
